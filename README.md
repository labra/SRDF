A simple library for RDF

This library is intended as a generic interface for RDF management which works with both Scala-JVM and ScalaJS

It contains the basic structure of RDF and a na√Øve implementation for testing purposes.

Further implementations can be done leveraging other libraries like Jena. 

Some libraries that use SRDF are:
