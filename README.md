SRDF - Simple RDF Library
=========================

A very simple library for RDF

This library is intended as a generic interface for RDF management which works with Scala-JVM and ScalaJS

It contains a simple implemeentation using lists which is not efficient at all.

Further implementations can be done leveraging other libraries like Jena

Some libraries that use this one:

* [Wesin](http://labra.github.io/wesin/)
* [ShExcala](http://labra.github.io/ShExcala/)
